Milestones:
~~1) Simple chat application. Node.js + Express + Socket.io~~
~~2) Server controls the state, client sends events to the server to change it.~~
~~3) Separate client and server into individual folders with separate `package.json` files.~~
~~4) Fully functioning movement + surfacing controls: movement leaves trace, surfacing erases it.~~
5) Placing connecting players into one of two teams. Making communication between server and client team-aware.
